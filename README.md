# Dissimilarity Based Concordancer
This repository contains reports and presentations to give a gist of my capstone project with CRIM Montreal.
Since the data and code used for the project is private the following files will help convey the goals and procedures used to make the project:
- [Project Presentation](https://github.com/MistryWoman/Capstone_CRIM/blob/master/Dissimilarity%20based%20concordancer.pdf)
- I also created a small scale implementation of the project for easy understanding using toy data [Notebook](https://github.com/MistryWoman/Capstone_CRIM/blob/master/Reka.ipynb) 
- To get an in depth look at the process and the analysis, take a look at our [final report](https://github.com/MistryWoman/Capstone_CRIM/blob/master/final%20report.pdf)
